Italian {it}pomo d\u0027Adamo,{\/it} German {it}Adamsapfel,{\/it} etc. Medieval authors, as Jacques de Vitry, applied {it}pomum Adam(i), Adami pomum,{\/it} etc., to various kinds of fruits, as the pomegranate, perhaps originally from their supposed superior quality (i.e., \u0022fruits of Paradise\u0022). According to Elmar Seebold ({it}Kluge, Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprachen,{\/it} 24. Auflage, 2002), medieval Arab medical authors called the laryngeal protuberance the \u0022pomegranate\u0022\u2014{it}pomum granatum{\/it} in Latin translation\u2014and the synonymous {it}pomum Adami{\/it} may have been copied in European vernaculars as a name for the laryngeal protuberance (a case of sense borrowing, and then sense transfer to a synonym). Caspar Bauhin, in his anatomical work {it}De corporis humani fabrica libri quattuor{\/it} (Basel, 1590), notes that both \u0022pomegranate\u0022 and \u0022Adam\u0027s apple\u0022 are vernacular words for the larynx (\u0022\u2026 partem protuberantem, que malum granatum et pomum Adami barbaris dicitur constituit.\u0022). Other anatomical authors also have {it}pomum Adami{\/it} as the Latinization of a vernacular name (Andr\u00e9 de Laurens, {it}Historia anatomica{\/it} [Lyons, 1605]: \u0022Huius suprema pars {it}br\u00f3nkhos,{\/it} quibusdam vulgo morsus \u0026 pomum Adami appellatur\u0022; Gabriele Falloppio, \u0022Institutiones Anatomicae,\u0022 in {it}Omnia, quae adhuc extant opera{\/it} [Venice, 1584]: \u0022\u2026 quam prominentiam aliqui vulgares appellant, Adami pomum\u0022). This expression has not surprisingly been subject to folk explanations, e.g., John Purcell, in {it}A Treatise of Vapours, or Hysterick Fits{\/it} (2nd ed., London, 1707), says \u0022\u2026 an eminence or protuberance plain to be felt and seen in the neck, which several anatomists call {it}Pomum Adami{\/it} or, the {it}Apple of Adam,{\/it} from a vulgar superstitious notion that when Adam eat the forbidden Apple it stuck in his Throat, and that God to perpetuate the memory of this his offence plac\u0027d the like protuberance in the throats of all his posterity; which is not quite so apparent in Women, because, say they, the Crime of Eve was less \u2026.\u0022 The notion, which according to Seebold goes back to the 19th century, that {it}pomum Adami{\/it} is a translation of a putative Medieval Hebrew {it}tapp\u016b\u0103\u1e25 ha\u0027\u0101dh\u0101m{\/it} (alleged to mean \u0022protuberance on a man,\u0022 supposedly reinterpreted as \u0022Adam\u0027s apple\u0022) is specious. No such expression with this meaning has been located in pre-Modern Hebrew."]]]],"date":"1625","shortdef":["the projection in the front of the neck formed by the largest cartilage of the larynx"]}]
